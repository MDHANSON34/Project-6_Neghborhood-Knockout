# Project-6_Neghborhood-Knockout

Goal: Develop a single-page application featuring a map of a "neighborhood" you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc)

### Installation:

Download the .zip file and double click index.html.  You will need to have access to a working internet connection for the application to work properly.  

### About:

This application features a map of Yosemite and highlights some of my favoirte places!  I hope it is used to help plan YOUR next trip to Yosemite National Park.
